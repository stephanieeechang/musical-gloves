# musicalGloves
The Musical Gloves are powered by Arduino Nanos and TCS34725 light sensors with an Iron-Man-inspired visual design. This project is created for novices in music serving as a simple, entertaining instrument that simulates the effects of percussion instruments and pianos. The technical approach behind conversion between colors and musical notes is taking the RGB values returned from the light sensor and pairing a range of RGB values to a certain note. For a more realistic piano simulation, the program includes conversion between flat and sharp notes as well, which is connected to buttons on the gloves.
